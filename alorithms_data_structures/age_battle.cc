// ProgrammerAgeBattle.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
/*"Two programmers who were once colleagues and liked to throw puzzles at each other, meet after several years. Keeping in the spirit of problem-solving challenges, Programmer 1 challenges Programmer 2 to guess the age of his 3 children and gives Programmer 2 the first clue that the product of age of his three children is 36. Programmer 2 requests another clue and Prog 1 provides the sum of the children's ages. Programmer 2 is still unable to determine the ages and requests one last clue. Programmer 1, feeling pity, says that the the oldest child plays cricket. This time Programmer 1 is able to finally guess the correct age of all the 3 children".*/
