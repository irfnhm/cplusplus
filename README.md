# dsamax

Welcome to dsamx - my learning of algorithms, data structures, and C++ programming!

## About

dsamax is a collection of C++ implementations of various algorithms and data structures, along with examples to help you with the concepts.

## Features

- Comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in C++
- Easy-to-navigate directory structure for quick access to specific topics
- Code solutions for common coding problems and challenges
- Regular updates with new algorithms, data structures, and coding exercises

## Usage

You can browse the code files in this repository to learn about different algorithms and data structures. Each topic is organized in its own directory, containing a C++ implementation file (.cpp/.cc) and a README file with explanations, examples, and usage instructions. You can clone this repository to your local machine and explore the code using your favorite C++ compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).

Feel free to use the code in this repository for educational purposes, personal projects, or coding competitions. You are encouraged to modify and customize the code to suit your needs. Contributions to this repository are also welcome, and you can submit a pull request with your changes or open an issue for suggestions or feedback.

## Contents

The dsamax repository covers a wide range of algorithms and data structures, including but not limited to:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Dynamic programming
- Data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables)
- And more!
