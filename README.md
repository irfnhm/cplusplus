# Exploring modern C++

This is a fun repo to practice (_C++17 through C++20_):
1. New C++ features.
2. Data structures and algorithms.
3. C++ mocking

The **checkout_gtest** demos a basic checkout flow and uses `googltest` as a mocking framework.

## Next
Parallel and concurrency is to be added later as I move on with implementing basic features and new algorithms.
