# Exploring modern C++

This is a demo ongoing project to practice new c++ features. Mostly start from c++17 and is gonna inlcude c++20 features.
Integrated `googltest` to be able to test and mock new c++ language feature implementations.
Parallel and concurrency is to be added later as I move on with implementing basic features and new algorithms.
