# Exploring modern C++

This is a fun repo to practice:
1. New C++ features.
2. Data structures and algorithms.
3. C++ mocking

Mostly start from C++17 through C++20 features.
The checkout_gtest demos a basic checkout flow and uses `googltest` as a mocking framework.

## Next
Parallel and concurrency is to be added later as I move on with implementing basic features and new algorithms.
